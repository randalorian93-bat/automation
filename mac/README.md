üñ•Ô∏è #mac-sys-report

A Python script that generates a weekly system report for macOS. It collects:

- Username
- Computer name
- macOS version
- Battery status
- Uptime
- Disk usage
- Local IP
- Public IP

The output is saved as a `.txt` file directly to the Desktop. This is useful for tracking system health or logging diagnostics over time.
